# Server Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own server using the `server.py` file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
- pip (Python package installer) installed on your machine.
- A Linux machine (this guide is tailored for Linux users).

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, you need to get a copy of the code on your local machine. You can do this by cloning the repository. Open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```
        git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Use the `cd` command to navigate into the directory that contains the `server.py` file:
    ```
        cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. **Install Required Python Packages**

    If the project includes a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all required packages with the following command:

    ```
        pip install <package>
    ```

    If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you may need to manually install packages that `server.py` depends on. Look for import statements at the top of `server.py` to see what packages are needed.

4. **Run the Server**

    You can start the server with the following command:
    ```
        python server.py
    ```
   If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating that the server is running.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors, they are most likely due to missing Python packages. Check the error message to see if it mentions any packages you don't have, then install them with `pip install <package_name>`.

If you're still having trouble, check the documentation for the packages you're using, or search for the error message online.

## Next Steps

Once the server is running, you can connect to it using a web browser. The server's URL will be `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port number specified in `server.py`.

Remember, any changes you make to `server.py` while the server is running will not take effect until you stop and restart the server.

## Exposing Your Server to the Internet

If you want your server to be accessible from the internet, not just your local network, you'll need to set up something called "port forwarding". This tells your router to send incoming connections on a specific port to your server.

However, be aware that exposing your server to the internet comes with security risks. If your server has any vulnerabilities, they could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. Therefore, it's important to make sure your server is secure before enabling port forwarding.

For testing or just for fun, it's usually safer and easier to keep your server local (i.e., not accessible from the internet). You can still access it from any device on your local network.

If you do decide to set up port forwarding, the process will depend on your router's model and firmware. You can usually find guides on how to do this by searching for "port forwarding" followed by your router's model name.
